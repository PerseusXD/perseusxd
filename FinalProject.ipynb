        "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It first appeared at the end of December in 2019 in Wuhan, China. This virus has its origins in bats and the epicenter of the outbreak early on was reported to have been linked to a large seafood and live animal market. The virus was originally suggested to have been spread through animal to person contact, and as later cases emerged, the virus was suggested to have been spread through person to person contact. What originally started in Wuhan, China has become a global pandemic, with an extremely high transmission rate and nations declaring states of emergencies. Up to date globally, there has been a total of 4.69 million confirmed cases, with 1.72 million recovered and 313,000 deaths. The United States has the highest number of both confirmed cases and deaths compared to the rest of the world. Compared to the second and third leading nations (Russia and the United Kingdom respectively), the United States has a whopping 1.51 million confirmed cases, whereas Russia has 282,000 confirmed cases, and the United Kingdom has only 243,000 confirmed cases. In this project, we look to determine which demographics are correlating factors that are causing such high rates in the United States.\n",

        "With the rise of the COVID-19 Pandemic comes the inevitable rise of the spread of misinformation. In this project, we decided to debunk several myths surrounding the COVID-19 crisis and test which demographics are more susceptible to infections/deaths. Using Python, regression analysis, and null-hypothesis testing, we set out to prove and disprove several assumptions made about whether certain factors influence COVID-19 death rates. We will look at the following variables: Smoking rate, income, population density, and pollution to see if they have an influence on COVID-19 Deaths.\n"

        "\n",
        "Smoking continues to be one of the leading causes of death around the world. In the United States, the unhealthy habit causes 480,000 deaths per year. As previously mentioned, Coronavirus is a respiratory disease, so one would expect that people with poor respiratory health would be at greater risk of infection and death.  To test whether there was or was not a correlation between smoking and Coronavirus deaths, we took the smoking rates of each state and compared them to the number of Coronavirus deaths of each state and performed a linear regression on the plot.  We used a linear regression because if there was a correlation, it would intuitively be a linear relation.  These are the results of our calculations.\n",

        "Based on the results of our linear regression, we have found that there is a meaningful relationship between population density and Coronavirus deaths. Our resulting p-value of 0.00158 is  way below our threshold of 0.05 thus we are able to reject our null hypothesis.  The p-value coupled with our plot leads us to conclude that population density **DOES** increase a person’s risk of dying from Coronavirus.  We theorize this to be because with a higher population density, more people come into contact with each other allowing the virus to spread more quickly."

        "Up until 2016, the EPA has reported massive trends in reduced air pollution in the United States, but with many environmental laws being repealed, the percentage of Americans living in areas with higher levels of pollution than the EPA recommends has increased.  In the past two years, the Washington Post reports that the concentration of fine-particle air pollution has risen by 5.5 percent due to repeals of environmental laws and climate change.  If the pandemic has not been dealt with and pollution continues to rise, using our model, we can predict how many more people will die per state."

        "It is no exaggeration to state that Covid-19 is a pandemic that needs to be taken extremely seriously. With the ever present media influencing every part of our daily lives however, we must take care in what we share to prevent the spread of misinformation and mass panic. After performing regression analysis and null-hypothesis testing, we were able to determine whether or not smoking rate, income, population density, and pollution are correlated to the death rates due to Covid-19. The results are as follows\n",

        "It is surprising to note that smoking rate is not a factor that contributes to a higher death rate, as Covid-19 is a virus that affects our respiratory system. One would imagine that since smoking damages our lungs, it would make smokers much weaker to the virus. Having performed the regression analysis and null-hypothesis testing, we can now confidently debunk this myth and ensure that people get the right information."
